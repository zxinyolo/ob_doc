\* * *\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**About this page**  \n  \nOur systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and not a robot. [Why did this happen?](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%92%96%E5%95%A1&ie=UTF-8#)\n  \n  \n\nThis page appears when Google automatically detects requests coming from your computer network which appear to be in violation of the [Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/policies/terms/)\n. The block will expire shortly after those requests stop. In the meantime, solving the above CAPTCHA will let you continue to use our services.  \n  \nThis traffic may have been sent by malicious software, a browser plug-in, or a script that sends automated requests. If you share your network connection, ask your administrator for help â€” a different computer using the same IP address may be responsible.
